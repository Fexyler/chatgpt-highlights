# chatgpt-highlights
My ChatGPT highlights that I find them worth saving, they may not be accurate but since they are showing me the path of my goal, they are worth saving.

## Format of this Repository
Each directory has the code inside. Some prompts/questions are just demanding an explanation or specification. Their answers and my prompts would be stored in 'conversation.md' files.
## Correctness of Answers
Some answers are not quite accurate. I try ChatGPT to give me the correct answer by correcting it. Sometimes it work, sometimes it doesn't. So do not rely on these answers!
